# fraud-analytics
In this project, I explored a Kaggle banking transactions dataset to identify fraudulent activity.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection

For a glimpse into how I think about fraud strategy and analytics, please take a look at the deck I've prepared: https://github.com/arianayoum/fraud-analytics/blob/main/fraud-strategy-and-analytics-deck-AY.pdf
